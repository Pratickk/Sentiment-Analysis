# Sentiment-Analysis
3-way sentiment analysis

In this project, I'll build a 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's in-built sentiment analysis engine.

I'll use a logistic regression classifier, bag-of-words features, and polarity lexicons (both in-built and external). I'll also create our own pre-processing module to handle raw tweets.
